IKV - Project II

Please read exercise 1, 4 and 9 to see what you should implement in
the file mpa_algs.c, based on the existing skeleton. Please insert your name
and student number where indicated.

There will be a penalty for poorly documented code or ill-conceived
coding style.

You can make use of the makefile with:
"make clean"
"make"

Your code should compile w/o any warnings! 
(flags: -O3 -Wall)

Have fun :)
